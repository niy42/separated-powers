# Requests 

Hi Niy, I hope you can see this! 

This is not really the 'correct' way of doing things, but it might be the fastest and easiest :) 

What I wanted to ask is if tomorrow I can do the following: 
- Try to get the front end to work on both our ends 
  - First pull your latest changes, and see if it works. 
  - If not, in my branch, fix any bugs and get it to work on my computer. 
  - Ask you to try out my branch and see if it also works on your end. 
  - If it works on both ends, replace the 'main' with your working frontend branch. 
- Propose a few changes to the UI. 
  - It would be nice if everyone can see all the roles and their powers. But only if you have the correct role can you interact with them.  
  - I can also - in my own branch - create some quick mock ups of what I mean. This will be relatively minor changes. 
- Start integrating the front end with the protocol as deployed on arbitrum sepolia. 
  - As it does not matter if the contract has been verified or not, I think we can just integrate the UI with the contracts on arbitrum sepolia. 
  - I can start doing this in my branch, see if it works, and then propose integration into the main branch. 

How does this sound? 

I think we can really pull it off quite quickly now. The main issue is that we get the workflow between us two on github to work.
